# School Project

True to our motto, *“There is always something to learn to improve ourselves and grow… together!”*, not just a motivational poster slogan but our way of living the community, after focusing in previous years on training and the free sharing of knowledge through online meetings, starting from October 2025 we decided to challenge ourselves by changing the way we deliver our activities.

Generative AI has arrived like a rocket and is revolutionizing everything, and the context is continuously evolving.
As good Pythonistas, we asked ourselves: *“How can we remain faithful to our mission of sharing and actively try to make a positive impact on society, here and now?”*

The answer was: involve schools!

Together with computer science teachers from upper secondary schools, we will try to co-create an additional learning space to study Python beyond the standard school curriculum.

The idea is to stimulate curiosity and creativity, introduce students to libraries and tools used to build games as well as tools commonly used in the professional world—such as pygamezero, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, FastAPI, and Flask—and involve them in small projects.

The goal? To spark their passion, let them experiment, let them make mistakes (and learn from bugs, like all of us).

These meetings are complementary to the regular course of study and can be used as tools for reinforcement and/or revision.

As always, we have shared details and prepared materials, which you will find in the folders below.
