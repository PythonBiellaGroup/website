2) **PyGameZero: an all-in-one engine, no hassle...**  
[https://github.com/PythonBiellaGroup/ProgettoScuole/blob/main/2025-26/01/01-pratica-Pygamezero%20Alieno.pdf]

The students were also introduced to this simple game, **“Hit the Alien”**:

The students were asked to understand how the game works and, as homework, to customize and improve it using their creativity.
