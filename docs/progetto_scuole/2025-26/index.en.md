# School Project 2025–2026

In October 2025 we started, in collaboration with Professor Roberto Borchia and his 3rd-year class of the **Scientific High School of Biella**, **Applied Sciences option**, with supplementary courses in *Data Science and Artificial Intelligence* (additional hours of Computer Science and Mathematics).

This class has been studying Python for about a year and uses **Thonny** as its IDE.

Together with the professor, we defined a schedule of meetings consisting of one two-hour session per month, each divided into a theoretical part and a more practical one.

Although the prepared material was tailored to the specific situation and curriculum of the class, we believe it can be reused and easily adapted to other contexts.

All the material is released as open source on the GitHub project:

While leaving the details of each meeting in specific folders, we note that the practical part of the first three meetings was aimed at reigniting passion and creativity in programming through the development of simple games using **PyGameZero**.

We did not limit ourselves to “recycling” games already created in the existing “path”, but instead updated the program with new games, accompanied by a completely renewed theoretical section.
