# Second Meeting

During the second meeting, two presentations were given:

1) **Code versioning, Git and GitHub**  
[https://github.com/PythonBiellaGroup/ProgettoScuole/blob/main/2025-26/02/01-teoria-versioni%20codice.pdf]

2) **PyGameZero: Tony in search of music**  
[https://github.com/PythonBiellaGroup/ProgettoScuole/blob/main/2025-26/02/02-pratica-Pygamezero%20Tony.pdf]

The students were also introduced to this simple game, **“Tony in Search of Music”**:  
[https://github.com/PythonBiellaGroup/LearningPythonWithGames/tree/main/game02_1]

Since GitHub was discussed in the first part of the meeting, the students were asked to create an account and their first project/repository containing their own personalized/modified version of the **“Hit the Alien”** game.
