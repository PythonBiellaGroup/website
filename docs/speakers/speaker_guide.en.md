# Guide for the perfect speaker

We have compiled simple guidelines based on feedback from members of the community in live streams or YouTube comments. In general, these are just common-sense tips that enable effective preparation and a good consumption of content during the event.

## **Event preparation**

- Coordinate with the organizers on the topics to be presented.

    !!! warning
        One of the cornerstones of our community is the sharing of knowledge, and that's why we ensure that all materials (meetup recordings, slides, code examples, etc.) are available to everyone, even for those who didn't directly participate in the event.
        If you have any concerns about sharing material because it might be potentially sensitive, protected by NDA, copyrighted, or anything else, don't hesitate to inform the community organizers in advance so that we can understand how to set up the meetup considering the aforementioned constraints. 
        We would really appreciate it ❤️

- Collaborate with the organizers on the evening's presentation text, which will be shared on social media.
- If using slides, if created for this purpose, and if possible, use the "Python Biella Group" templates.

## **Before the event**

### Material

- Arrange the material you will present so that it is easily accessible with just a few clicks.
- Close windows with personal documents or chats to prevent them from accidentally being shared.

### Audio

- Ensure that the microphone is "adequately" close to the mouth.
- Check that the volume is correct.
- Ensure that there are no audio disturbances in the area.

### Video

- It is advisable for the speaker to enable video during the presentation.
- In the case of live coding or presenting code in an IDE, ensure that the font is "adequately" enlarged and that the material is ready.

## **Immediately after the event**

### Share

- Provide the organizers with any presented slides.
- Provide the organizers with the possible GitHub link to the presented code.

---

## **After the event**

### Youtube video

- Once the video is published, report any corrections to the description.

### Answering question from the community

- At least for the first few days after the event and video publication, monitor the comments to respond to any questions.
