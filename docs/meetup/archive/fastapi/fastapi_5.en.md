## Intro

This is the fifth and final evening, in which we covered async-await, compared FastAPI and Django, discussed OAuth2 authentication, introduced profiling, and briefly mentioned Dockerization. We are aware that there are still many topics to explore, but we thank those who followed us during this interesting journey!

* Async await - theory
* Async await applied to FastCash
* Comparison of FastAPI, Django, and DRF
* OAuth2 authentication
* Profiling
* Dockerization hints
