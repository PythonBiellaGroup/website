## Intro

How can data privacy be preserved in a world full of algorithms and information?

Together with [Simona Mazzarino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simona-mazzarino-3ba7b7225/) ([Clearbox.ai](https://www.clearbox.ai/)), we will explore **[Nerpii](https://pypi.org/project/nerpii/)**, an open-source library that uses Named Entity Recognition to protect structured data by generating synthetic personal information.

Agenda:

* Introduction to privacy in Machine Learning
* Challenges, risks, and complexities of privacy in the world of Artificial Intelligence
* Overview of the Nerpii library
* Advanced practices to ensure privacy in Machine Learning
* Implications of technology in the world of Generative Artificial Intelligence
