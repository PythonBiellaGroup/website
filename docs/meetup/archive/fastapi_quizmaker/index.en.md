# Fastapi - Quiz maker

In this series of two meetings, we will review some concepts of FastApi that we had already seen in this [learning path](../fastapi/index.en.md) and we will try to develop a platform for creating and executing multiple-choice tests. The application will also be enhanced by AI, which will provide an explanation to the user in case of incorrect answers.

We will do all this together with [Claudio Cama](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudio-cama/), founder of [Appbox.cloud](https://appbox.cloud/).
