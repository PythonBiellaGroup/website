## Intro

Second meetup on how to build a project with FastAPI from scratch in production.

During the evening, we used FastAPI to develop a platform for creating and running multiple-choice tests where users can add or remove questions (with their respective answers), generate tests that randomly select questions, and take tests, receiving an explanation from AI in case of wrong answers.

In this second meetup, we will see how to go into production and release the developed application, exploring together some advanced features.

Meetup hosted by [Claudio Cama](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudio-cama/), founder of [Appbox.cloud](https://appbox.cloud/).
