## Intro

How to build a project with FastAPI from scratch in production?

During the meetup, we used FastAPI to develop a platform for creating and executing multiple-choice tests where users can add or remove questions (with their respective answers), generate tests that randomly select questions, and take tests, receiving explanations from AI in case of incorrect answers.

We take advantage of this small project to discuss various features of FastAPI such as the use of templates, auto-generated documentation, type checking, deployment phase, and much more.
