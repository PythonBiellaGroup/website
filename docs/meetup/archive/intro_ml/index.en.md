# Introduction to Machine Learning

In this exciting series of three meetings, we will explore the fundamental basics of Machine Learning and learn how to use one of the most powerful and versatile libraries available: scikit-learn.

Machine Learning is a discipline that has revolutionized the way we tackle complex problems in areas such as artificial intelligence, data analysis, and predicting future outcomes. Scikit-learn is an open-source library for Machine Learning in Python that offers a wide range of algorithms, tools, and resources to help you develop Machine Learning models efficiently and effectively.
