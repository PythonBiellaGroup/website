## Intro

With [Nicola Moretto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicola-moretto-ba197040/), CEO and Co-founder of [QMates](https://qmates.tech/) we returned to the origins of agile by addressing these questions:
 
âœ… What prompted the creators of the manifesto to seek a new way of developing technological products?   
âœ… Is it still relevant today?   
âœ… We will explore the Agile Manifesto and the principles of agility and how they can help an entire organization develop more rapidly and flexibly.
