## Intro

Second evening exploring high-frequency trading.

Tonight, we will see how to execute various financial operations at high speed online with Python, also introducing several financial concepts such as the order book, bid, ask, spread.

We will also discuss a statistical method on how to model the price of Bitcoin over time, drawing some useful insights.

Attention: with these videos, we aim to discuss technology and not provide any financial advice of any kind.

In particular, we will cover:

* Adding conditions to better structure an HFT strategy + live coding
* Alternative approach to algo-trading: breaking down btc cycles to generate long-term signals + live coding
