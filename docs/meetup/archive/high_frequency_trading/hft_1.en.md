## Intro

How to place high-frequency financial orders using only the order book of a market?

Tonight, we will see how to execute various financial operations at high speed online with Python, also introducing several financial concepts such as the order book, bid, ask, and spread.

Attention: with these videos, we aim to discuss technology and not provide any financial advice of any kind.

In particular, we will cover:

* Theoretical introduction (order book, bid, ask, and spread)
* Description of Python libraries
* Implementation in Python of atomic functions
* Implementation of an algorithm
* Live execution
* Q&A
