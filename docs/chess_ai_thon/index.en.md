As the digital era continues to transform the world of work, the ability to code has become increasingly crucial for professionals in fields ranging from software development to data analysis. Recognizing the growing importance of programming skills, it is imperative that Vocational Education and Training (VET) institutions adapt and equip students with these competencies to meet the demands of the modern job market.

Despite the clear importance of computing skills, VET schools currently fall short in providing comprehensive training in this area, and this challenge is becoming even more significant and demanding due to the disruptive effect that the pervasive spread of Artificial Intelligence is having on everyday life and on businesses.

Moreover, transversal (soft) skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and strategic planning are highly sought after by employers and the broader job market.

These skills transcend specific professional roles and are crucial for adapting to the dynamic nature of the contemporary workplace. Teamwork, communication, and adaptability are also essential aspects, and student preparation in VET schools should be able to mirror the collaborative environments prevalent in many professional contexts.

The ChessAIthon Consortium is convinced that addressing a yet unexplored challenge requires a strongly unconventional approach and believes that bridging the educational gaps highlighted above can be achieved through the integration of chess logic into lessons and curricula.

Chess, a game renowned for its emphasis on strategy, problem-solving, and critical thinking, indeed serves as a powerful tool for developing both transversal skills and the foundational knowledge necessary to use programming and AI with greater awareness and logical reasoning, making it an ideal complement to traditional VET programming education.
